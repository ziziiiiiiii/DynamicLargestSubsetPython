This project was made for CECS 328 at CSULB. It is written in Python. It contains a dynamic solution to finding the largest subset array of containers that can fit on a ship while adhering to constraints on the number of a given item that can be taken. 't' represents toasters, 'w' washing machines and 'd' dryers.

Example function calls are included in notes at the bottom of the program.
